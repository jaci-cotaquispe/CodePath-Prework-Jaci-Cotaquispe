## App Brainstorming 

1. Kindle App
   - Kindle's homepage or "Book Shelf" feature which allows users to view all the books they are in progress of reading. 
   - Grid-like view 
2. Instagram 
   - The colored boarder on people's profiles to indicate they have something on their story. 
   - the navigation bar on the bottom rather than the top

## Notes

One main challenge I had was understanding the difference between Actions and Incidents. At first, I created an Incident for the Button 
instead of an Action which made it difficult to add a function when the button is tapped.
